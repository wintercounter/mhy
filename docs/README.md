## `mhy`?

> Out-of-the box development environment.

`mhy` \(my\) is supposed to be a development/production environment/compiler/ecosystem _out-of-the_ box. I just simply had enough of having multiple instances of the same npm packages on my machine, and the need to setup a development environment each time I start a new project.

I hate the need to configure a bunch of configs/scripts, the need to open up multiple terminals and start commands separately. I hate that I always have to align different configs to be able to start development \(like Babel for Webpack, Jest and Storybook\).

This is `mhy` own development environment, how I like it and/or want it to be, instantly, anywhere, simply.

## A tool for simple

* app/site development
* package/library development
* build process setup
* project initialization
* interoperability
* configuration building

## Problems trying to solve

* Zero-configuration
* Out-of-the box
* Portability
* Simple customization
* Using package.json for any config options
* Boot templates for easy starts
* Package hell: No more multiple installs on the same machine
* Single command and UI to run all necessary process
* Less boilerplate
* Shared configs across different tools
* Faster deployments using pre-built and public docker images
* Providing common/popular/standard packages
* Up-to-date policy

## Supported tools

`mhy` is providing many common/popular packages out-of the box. There are continuous adjustments being made to the includes to match the most common needs and being able to develop without the need of your own `npm install` command ever again. The best is to check the dependencies of our `package.json` for the included packages, and I also advice you to check out our sources for more details.
